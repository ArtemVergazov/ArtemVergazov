ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArtemVergazov!

I study at Skoltech, Advanced Computational Science MSc program, and specialize in Mathematics, Data Sciences and Numerical Computational Methods.

I had my BSc at the Faculty of Physics of Lomonosov Moscow State University in Math Modeling and Numerical Methods.

I am a student intern at a research group at Schlumberger Moscow Research (SMR). With my skills, I am helping SMR to reach out the ambitious goal to be a center of excellence for scientific computing in Schlumberger.

I am fond of math, programming and physics.

For description of my particular project involvements, programming languages I use and list of main achievements go to my resume: https://github.com/ArtemVergazov/ArtemVergazov/blob/main/resume.pdf
