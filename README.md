ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArtemVergazov!

I study at Skoltech, Advanced Computational Science MSc program, and specialize in Mathematics, Data Sciences and Numerical Computational Methods.

I had my BSc at the Faculty of Physics of Lomonosov Moscow State University in Math Modeling and Numerical Methods.

I have experience as a student intern at a research group at Schlumberger Moscow Research (SMR). With my skills, I was helping SMR to reach out the ambitious goal to be a center of excellence for scientific computing in Schlumberger. I have worked there since 2019 until 2022.

I keep growing as a specialist in math modeling applied to oil-gas industry. Currently I am emplyed at the Saudi Aramco Innovations center at the MSU Science Park. There I develop front-end and back-end for the scientific applications which are used by Aramco engineers at the fields.

I am fond of math, programming and physics.

For description of my particular project involvements, programming languages I use and list of main achievements, please refer to my CV:
